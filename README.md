# 📊 Expense Analysis for Office Park Billing  

### **First-Time Data Analytics Project** 🚀  
Welcome to my **first-ever data analytics project**, where I manually collected and analyzed invoice data for my company (name withheld). This project was driven by a real-world challenge: understanding the **spending and billing trends** that the company was receiving from the **office park where we were renting**. My boss wanted clarity on how we were being billed, so I took on the task of transforming unstructured invoice data into actionable financial insights.

## 🏗 **Project Overview**  
This project involved converting **EML email files** (containing invoices) into **PDFs**, extracting the relevant financial data **manually**, and entering it into a structured spreadsheet. Once compiled, I performed:  
✔ **Data Cleaning** – Removing inconsistencies and ensuring accuracy  
✔ **Sorting & Grouping** – Categorizing expenses for analysis  
✔ **Visualization & Trend Identification** – Creating clear graphs to showcase spending patterns  

The final report tracks **monthly expenses** across categories such as:  
🔹 **Electricity Usage** – Understanding peak months and efficiency shifts  
🔹 **Solar Energy** – Tracking sustainability and cost reductions  
🔹 **Rent & Levies** – Studying consistency and adjustments  
🔹 **Parking & Training Costs** – Identifying stable vs. fluctuating expenses  

This hands-on process introduced me to **data transformation, organization, and visualization**, making it a great learning experience in **data analytics**.
